# Tic-Tac-Toe AI Agent

This project is an AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in Python. The AI agent is capable of playing using **four different algorithms**, providing a challenging opponent that can adapt to various strategies. The goal of this project is to explore different AI techniques for solving classic board games and compare their performance and decision-making processes.

## Features

- **Minimax Algorithm**: A basic AI that evaluates all possible moves to ensure the best outcome.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: An optimized version of Minimax that reduces the number of nodes evaluated, making it faster.
- **Heuristic-based Minimax**: Adds heuristics to the standard Minimax for quicker decision-making without evaluating every possible move.
- **Custom Strategy**: A special strategy to add variety and new challenges to the game.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3**
- Required libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install tkinter
  ```
  -OR on arch-
  ```bash
  pacman -S tk
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/3ab3z2/Tic-tac-toe.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd Tic-tac-toe
   ```

3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   python Trial.py
   ```

## Usage

- On launching the game, you will be able to select which algorithm the AI will use to play against you.
- The game will display the Tic-Tac-Toe grid, where you can play as 'O' while the AI plays as 'X'.
- Try different algorithms and compare how the AI behaves!

## Algorithms

1. **Minimax Algorithm**  
   The AI evaluates all possible moves and picks the optimal one to either win or force a draw.

2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**  
   A more efficient version of Minimax, which cuts off branches that don't need to be evaluated, speeding up the decision-making process.

3. **Heuristic-based Minimax**  
   Introduces heuristics to guide the AI in making faster decisions, especially useful for larger game boards or when limited computational resources are available.

4. **Custom Strategy**  
   A unique twist that introduces more variability and challenges to the gameplay. Test it out to see how it differs from the other strategies.
